# Musics Data Back End
This is a back end exercise written in javascript. It is API for musics: add, list all, show details, edit, and delete. There are also for albums. The framework used is Hapi. Initially, I think this was easy, but after doing some stuff, it was pretty challenging. I test this with postman with given test case.

Thank you for reading this.
